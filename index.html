          <p>
            I am a responsible and dedicated individual who is passionate about learning and developing my skills to the fullest potential. 
            I can master abilities really quickly with little to non supervision and have no problem giving extra time to capacitate myself towards being part of a professional team. 
            My outgoing personality allows me to build confidence, seek feedback, and continuously improve.
            I am industrial Mechanical engineer (GPA of 3.0/4.0., Top 10 student in 700+ generation)
            My professional experience resides primarily in the research industry where I developed my programming passion. 
            Recently I have decided to fully transition towards software development and have been studying towards this goal : IBM Full Stack Software Developer Professional Certificate, Machine Learning From Standford University.

          Working with Iñaki has been an awesome experience. 
          Not only he loves sharing his personal experience, but also is seeking for feedback to make sure everything is right. 
          For any future projects that need his expertise I would definitely want to work with him again.

          I had worked along with Iñaki during the initial phase of our venture which needed Web development. 
          Unluckily I didn't have the opportunity to share a long journey with him, but from what I got the opportunity to experience he makes the best out of any working environment.
          He is versatile and will be an asset for any organisation!
